# ArtTrackr

## Overview
ArtTrackr is a simple game made to take advantage of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's (MET) Open Access Collection. Our game aims entertain users while allowing them to test their knowledge of art history.

This project utilizes the Google Maps API to allow users to guess a location on a map where they think a painting is from. The paintings are meant to be pulled from the MET's database using their API (needs to be further developed. As of right now, the game uses a static array.)
